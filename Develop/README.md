# Installation
    
  Please, download the entire folder "Develop" from this repository. Then save your screenshots in the directory "images" inside of the directory "assets". Open the Develop folder from your Gitbash and run the command "node index".

# Usage
    
  You have to answer correctly all the questions, provide detailed information about your project. If you do not provide an answer it will be 'no' by default. Have all the information about your project in your hands. If you have credits to share don't forget to have saved your colaborators' Github. If you are using any third part asset, don't forget to insert it's creators name and web presence. Using tutorials? Insert the links as well. When the app ask for a link, try to copy and paste instead of type to avoid issues. If something goes wrong, you can always edit your readme file manually. In the end, you will have your README in this very same directory (Develop).
